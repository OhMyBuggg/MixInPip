# MixInPip
It's our graduate project about using mixology into pip to improve calculate efficiency.

## Brief
Pubgrub is a algorithm which is used to do version solving in Pub - the package manager in dart lang. And it use the different way to solve the version problem which is seem to be more efficient.

And mixology is the python version Pubgrub, we think it's better for us to use this repo.
